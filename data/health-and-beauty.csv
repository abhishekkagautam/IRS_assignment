Our Colour Revitalise shampoo & conditioner, infused with Rosemary and Nutri-Oil, helps to keep your colour luminous for up to 12 weeks (Tresemme Colour Revitalise vs non-conditioning shampoo, based on 3.5 washes per week). The advanced formula of our conditioner will replenish vital moisture leaving coloured hair with a salon-healthy look and silky finish. Colour stays gorgeous for longer while hair is softer and more manageable. Our expert's tips: start with our colour care shampoo. Follow with the Tresemme Colour Revitalise Conditioner. Apply it from mid lengths to ends. Run a wide-tooth comb or fingers from roots to tips to detangle and work into the hair. Leave on for 2-3 minutes.

The unique composition of skin’s own moisturiser, moisture-locking lipids and care providing oils bind and hold water in the skin thus the moisture cannot evaporate easily into the surrounding area. The skin is well protected from drying out, because water loss is reduced and the moisture level of the skin is increased. The latest testing methods have shown that the perfect combination of high quality ingredients of our NIVEA body lotions together with the NIVEA Deep Moisture Serum penetrates deeply into the skin, locking moisture and providing deep moisture for 48h. The product comes in a practical pump bottle that makes application especially easy.","Aqua, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Alcohol Denat., Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Maris Sal, Dimethicone, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Phenoxyethanol, Linalool, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Citronellol, Parfum",Nan,Nan,https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/268139800

Olay Anti-Wrinkle Pro Vital night cream is specifically designed to address the specific needs of mature skins and visibly reduce even deep wrinkles while you sleep. Research has shown that your skin starts to behave differently as it matures. Structural changes in the dermal matrix and reduction in collagen levels make the skin appear thinner and less bouncy. Targeted Vitamin Complex, a sophisticated multi-vitamin blend of anti-ageing hero ingredients niacinamide, vitamin e and pro-vitamin B5, helps to protect the skin while intense hydration helps restore firmness and elasticity. Mature skin appear to behave like younger skin. As a result skin is more resilient, feels more bouncy and replumped and even deep wrinkles appear reduced.","Aqua, Glycerin, Cetyl Palmitate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Stearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Panthenol, Dimethicone, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Tocopherol, Lecithin, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Zea Mays Oil, Carbomer, PEG-100 Stearate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG/PPG-18/18 Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide, Disodium EDTA, Glyceryl Oleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Citric Acid, Methylparaben, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Propylparaben, Parfum, Benzyl Benzoate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Hydroxycitronellal, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Linalool, Limonene, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, CI 75130",Nan,Nan,https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/267237403

Brylcreem Strong 24 Hour Hold Gel 150Ml,No ratings yet,Nan,3.00,"Brylcreem is a British brand of hair styling products and has been styling men since 1928. With quality that has stood the test of time, our Original Men’s Grooming Strong Gel delivers 24 hour hold. Our Strong Hold Gel provides classic, strong and durable styles, leaving you without a flake in sight. Squeeze a small amount of gel onto your palms, rub between your hands and apply to damp or towel dried hair and use your fingers to style. To get the most out of your product apply our Strong Hold Gel to damp hair as it will spread more evenly, giving you better structure. For the iconic swept back look, use a comb to keep hair looking smart, and polished. Brylcreem was an instant hit with British soldiers during WWII. It quickly became standard issue for military pilots, who had a reputation for being cutting edge and sophisticated, to keep their hair perfectly in place. Through the decades the look has stuck. From slick 50’s ad execs to today’s red carpet. 89 years later, the look continues to be an icon of men’s style, giving groomed, sharp styles that don’t take forever to achieve.

Dove Derma Spa Summer Revived F/Med Limited 200Ml,(108),4.5,4.35,"Want to get a healthy-looking bronze glow without exposing your skin to the sun? Bask in Dove DermaSpa Summer Revived Body Lotion and treat yourself to that holiday hue all year round. Dove has combined dermatological care with beauty expertise to develop Cell-Moisturisers - key moisturising actives compressed from natural seed oils. By combining this technology with natural-looking tanners for the first time, Dove created a pampering gradual tan lotion. It leaves skin full of moisture and feeling cared for.                                                                                                                                                            To enjoy smooth, moisturised skin that has a natural-looking tan, simply massage this Dove self tanning lotion evenly over clean, dry skin, and then wash your hands thoroughly. Always apply a separate sunscreen product if you are going to be spending time in the sun and remember to exfoliate your skin before using the Dove self-tanning lotion. The results? Glowing, sun-kissed skin, whatever the weather.

So, whether you’re a fan of the natural look or love a larger-than-life colour trend, it’s important to take care of your new shade by using coloured hair products that are mild & gentle. That's why we developed Tresemme Pro Collection Colour Shineplex shampoo as part of our first-ever sulphate-free system. Using a patented blend of two silicones that distribute evenly over the hair fibre for smooth and moisturised hair, the conditioning formula helps repair damage to lock colour in for longer. Our professional-quality formula is enriched with camellia oil, known for its regenerative properties, bringing out your hair’s natural beauty. Our unique formulation delivers a long-lasting effect that helps you get & keep vibrant colour and shine for up to 12 weeks without the use of parabens, dyes or sulphates. How to use the Shineplex range: first, cover your hair with an abundant amount of Pro Collection shampoo. Then, gently massage the scalp and roots with your fingertips to work into a lather. Slightly squeeze the shampoo from roots to ends - then rinse thoroughly. Then apply the conditioner from mid-lengths to ends. Work anything that's left through roots. Run a wide-tooth comb or your fingers from roots to ends to detangle and fully coat hair. Leave on for 2-3 minutes and rinse thoroughly. Style with your favourite Tresemme styling products as needed. Tresemme delivers professional-quality and trend-inspired products that care for your hair and help you style it however you want, every day. Like our tips and haircare products?

So, whether you’re a fan of the natural look or love a larger-than-life colour trend, it’s important to take care of your new shade by using coloured hair products that are mild & gentle. That's why we developed Tresemme Pro Collection Colour Shineplex conditioner as part of our first-ever sulphate-free system. Using a patented blend of two silicones that distribute evenly over the hair fibre for smooth and moisturised hair, the conditioning formula helps repair damage to lock colour in for longer. Our professional-quality formula is enriched with camellia oil, known for its regenerative properties, bringing out your hair’s natural beauty. Our unique formulation delivers a long-lasting effect that helps you get & keep vibrant colour and shine for up to 12 weeks without the use of parabens, dyes or sulphates. How to use the Shineplex range: first, cover your hair with an abundant amount of Pro Collection shampoo. Then, gently massage the scalp and roots with your fingertips to work into a lather. Slightly squeeze the shampoo from roots to ends - then rinse thoroughly. Then apply the conditioner from mid-lengths to ends. Work anything that's left through roots. Run a wide-tooth comb or your fingers from roots to ends to detangle and fully coat hair. Leave on for 2-3 minutes and rinse thoroughly. Style with your favourite Tresemme styling products as needed. Tresemme delivers professional-quality and trend-inspired products that care for your hair and help you style it however you want, every day. Like our tips and haircare products?

Simple Oilbegone Micellar Water Skin Face 400 Ml,(15),4.1,4.65,"Wondering how to get rid of oily skin? With Simple Daily Skin Detox Oil Be Gone Micellar Water you can now say goodbye to pore-clogging impurities and excess oil and hello to clear, fresh skin! This micellar water is the perfect cleanser for oily skin, made with our most advanced micellar cleansing technology and infused with a detoxifying blend of thyme, zinc, and witch hazel to deeply clean pores and remove excess oil. Oily skin is left feeling refreshed, balanced and less oily, and with no greasy residue that can lead to clogged pores and blackheads. When skin is exposed to external aggressors such as heat, pollution or products containing harsh chemicals, it can become sensitive and trigger an overproduction of oil and sebum, which can lead to clogged pores and spots. Removing excess oil is key to preventing new blemishes from forming. But using a harsh facial cleanser or make-up remover can weaken skin’s defence against harmful bacteria, leaving it prone to spots and blemishes. This Simple Micellar Water is our most effective yet gentle face cleanser for oily skin. We have developed it to be effective, without over-cleansing or drying, so it helps to maintain the skin’s microbiome balance. By enhancing the skin’s natural defences, it is better able to stand up to spot-causing triggers like bacteria For breathable, clear skin day after day! How to use: 1. Apply a generous amount to a cotton pad. 2. Wipe the pad all around the face, eyes and lips. No need to rinse! For best results, follow with our Daily Skin Detox SOS Clearing Booster.","•	Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cetylpyridinium Chloride, Citric Acid, Hamamelis Virginiana Leaf Water, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Pantolactone, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Thymus Vulgaris Flower/Leaf Extract, Zinc PCA. •	Ingredients correct at time of publishing.

The unique composition of skin’s own moisturiser, moisture-locking lipids and care providing oils bind and hold water in the skin thus the moisture cannot evaporate easily into the surrounding area. The skin is well protected from drying out, because water loss is reduced and the moisture level of the skin is increased. The latest testing methods have shown that the perfect combination of high quality ingredients of our NIVEA body lotion and lotions together with the NIVEA Deep Moisture Serum penetrates deeply into the skin, locking moisture and providing deep moisture for 48h. An effect you can not only feel but also see.

Simple Daily Skin Detox Sos Serum 25Ml,(41),4.1,4.00,"Wondering how to get rid of spots? Simple Daily Skin Detox SOS Clearing Booster is your new instant skin purifier! Following in the footsteps of our award-winning Hydrating Moisturiser, we’ve created our best primer for oily skin prone to blemishes. When skin is exposed to the environment, it can lead to an overproduction of oil and sebum, causing it to become sensitive and prone to breakouts and blemishes. This Simple spot zapper is made with a detoxifying blend of concentrated 10% witch hazel, thyme and zinc; providing long-lasting results against oily skin and blemishes whilst being gentle on your skin. Small yet powerful, with a unique ultra-light gel formula, this face cream is designed to be used in 2 ways: 1) as a primer for all-day shine control on oil-prone areas such as the t-zone 2) as a blemish remover to help reduce redness and soothe irritation. Used daily, this moisturiser for oily skin helps to prevent future blemishes and leaves skin looking visibly clearer, fresh, and balanced day after day. How to use Simple Daily Skin Detox SOS Clearing Booster: 1. Apply a small amount to the t-zone daily after using a facial wash or face cleanser and before applying moisturiser. 2. Dab directly on blemishes up to 3 times a day.","Aqua, Hamamelis Virginiana Leaf Water, Glycerin, PEG-20 Glyceryl Laurate, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Aminomethyl Propanol, Allantoin, Benzophenone-4, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Lactic Acid, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Thymus Vulgaris Flower/Leaf Extract, Zinc PCA",Nan,Nan,https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/302347669

We then capture their transformative effects with one goal in mind: to help people get in the mood they want to be in.

Fragrance has the power to lift you when you’re down, to awaken you when you rise, to make us sleep, love, create, dream. It has the power to genuinely transform how you feel. In fact, there's hardly a mood that cannot be moved by fragrance. And there’s barely a person on earth who can’t be affected by the right scent.
