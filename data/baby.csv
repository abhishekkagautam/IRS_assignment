Baby Dove Calming Nights Lotion 400Ml,(30),4.7,4.99,"Your baby's bedtime should be all about relaxation, care and pleasure. That is why it is important to choose appropriate baby care products, which will meet the very high standards of baby skin nourishment. Did you know that in its first year, a baby's skin is up to 30% thinner than in adults? With this idea in mind we have created the new Baby Dove Calming Nights Lotion whose gentle baby care formula will help your little one relax and will provide their gentle skin with protection that it needs. Not only does our baby lotion help replenish essential skin moisture and nutrients that are lost during a bath, but it also gives out a relaxing milk and chamomile scent that will allow your baby to calm down, relax and fall asleep more easily. Not only is our product dermatologically and paediatrically approved, but it also pH-neutral, which is crucial in maintaining the skin's microbiome, that is, the living layer which plays an important role in keeping your baby’s skin healthy and resilient. Use this baby lotion for sensitive skin and dry skin as a helping hand after bathtime to soothe your baby’s skin dryness and leave it fresh, healthy and touchably softer.","Aqua, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Stearic Acid, Glycol Stearate, Dimethicone, Isopropyl Isostearate, Triethanolamine, Tapioca Starch, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Stearamide AMP",Nan,Nan,https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/304993009
