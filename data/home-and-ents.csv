The series began in 1994 with the episode 'The One Where it All Began', where Rachel jilts her man at the altar and comes into the lives of the rest of the gang. And finished with the two-parter 'The Last One' in which Ross is desperate to be with Rachel, but she is set on going to Paris. He and Phoebe chase her to the airport, but accidentally go to the wrong airport. They manage to get to the right airport just in time, and Ross tells Rachel he loves her, but, in a dazed state, she gets on the plane anyway...

Succession Season 1 And Season 2 Boxset,No ratings yet,Nan,25.00,"Series 1 - Although he has no plans to step aside as the head of Waystar Royco, the international media conglomerate controlled by his family, aging patriarch Logan Roy is contemplating what the future holds. He has lingered in the limelight longer than even he thought he would, and now family members want to run the company as they see fit. Despite a best-laid succession plan, tempers flare over Logan's intentions. Kendall Roy, Logan's eldest son from his second marriage and a division president at the firm, is the heir apparent. As Kendall attempts to solidify his eventual takeover, he and the three other Roy children face a difficult choice as company control and family loyalties collide.

Beginning where the first season dramatically left off, Season 2 follows the Roys—media tycoon Logan (Brian Cox) and his four grown children—as they struggle to retain control of their empire amidst internal and external threats. As Kendall (Jeremy Strong) deals with fallout from his hostile takeover attempt and guilt from his involvement in a fatal accident, Shiv (Sarah Snook) stands poised to make her way into the upper-echelons of the company, while Roman (Kieran Culkin) reacquaints himself with the business by starting at the bottom, and Connor (Alan Ruck) launches an unlikely bid for president.",Nan,Nan,Nan,https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/308118730
